App calls Users with argument of (22)

Users is an async function that takes in the amount as number.
const randomUsersResponse is axios get request to API with amount from amount parameter.
const users is the data from that response which is an array of objects

const templatedUsers is an empty array

for of loop over users array where U is current item.

const templatedUser instantiates User for all items of users array passing in the item/object U

We push on each of the templated users to the templatedUsers array.

User 
Has a variable called template which is a function taking in user.

The actual User function takes in passedUser which is U parameter from Users.js

Could just be return template with argument of passedUser, that would kick back the template for each one. But I think tank put in one API request to make sure it returns something even if you donâ€™t provide a number. Defaults to 500

Then return that array for use in App.js
